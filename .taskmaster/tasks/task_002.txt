# Task ID: 2
# Title: Set Up Git Repository and Branch Protection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize Git repository with the required branching strategy and configure GitHub branch protection rules as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
1. Initialize Git repository: `git init`
2. Create initial commit with basic project structure
3. Create the three required branches:
   - `main` (production)
   - `staging` (staging environment)
   - `development` (active development)
4. Push to GitHub repository
5. Configure branch protection rules for `main` and `staging` branches:
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
   - Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - Include administrators in restrictions
   - Prevent force pushes and deletions
6. Create documentation in README.md explaining the Git workflow:
   - Feature branch creation from `development`
   - PR process
   - Branch promotion workflow

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify all three branches exist in the repository
2. Attempt to push directly to protected branches and confirm it's blocked
3. Create a test PR and verify protection rules are enforced
4. Verify documentation accurately reflects the implemented workflow

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Local Git Repository [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a local Git repository with initial commit and basic project structure
### Details:
1. Navigate to project directory in terminal
2. Initialize Git repository: `git init`
3. Create a .gitignore file with appropriate entries for Next.js projects
4. Add all initial project files: `git add .`
5. Make initial commit: `git commit -m "Initial commit with project structure"`
6. Create the three required branches:
   - `git branch main` (if not already on main)
   - `git checkout -b staging`
   - `git checkout -b development`
7. Verify branches: `git branch -a`

## 2. Create GitHub Repository and Push Code [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create a new GitHub repository and push the local repository with all branches
### Details:
1. Log in to GitHub account
2. Click '+ New repository' button in the top-right corner
3. Enter repository name and description
4. Keep repository public or private as required
5. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
6. Click 'Create repository'
7. Copy the repository URL
8. In terminal, add the remote: `git remote add origin [repository-url]`
9. Push all branches:
   - `git checkout main && git push -u origin main`
   - `git checkout staging && git push -u origin staging`
   - `git checkout development && git push -u origin development`
10. Verify all branches appear in GitHub repository

## 3. Configure Branch Protection Rules [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Set up GitHub branch protection rules for main and staging branches
### Details:
1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub
2. Go to 'Settings' tab
3. Select 'Branches' from the left sidebar
4. Under 'Branch protection rules', click 'Add rule'
5. For 'main' branch:
   - Enter 'main' in the branch name pattern
   - Check 'Require pull request reviews before merging'
   - Set required approvals to at least 1
   - Check 'Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed'
   - Check 'Require status checks to pass before merging'
   - Check 'Require branches to be up to date before merging'
   - Save changes
6. Repeat steps 4-5 for 'staging' branch
7. Test protection by attempting to push directly to protected branches
8. Create a test PR to verify protection rules are enforced
