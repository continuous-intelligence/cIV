# Task ID: 3
# Title: Configure GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflows
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing, linting, and deployment as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
1. Create `.github/workflows` directory
2. Create `ci.yml` workflow file for development branch checks:
   - Configure workflow to run on pushes to `development` branch
   - Add job for ESLint using `eslint .` with appropriate configuration
   - Add job for TypeScript type checking using `tsc --noEmit`
   - Add job for Prettier formatting check using `prettier --check .`
   - Add job for build verification using `next build`
   - Add job for bundle size analysis using `@next/bundle-analyzer`
3. Create `staging-deploy.yml` for staging deployments
4. Create `production-deploy.yml` for production deployments
5. Configure workflows to use GitHub Secrets for any sensitive information
6. Set up status checks to be required for PRs to protected branches

# Test Strategy:
1. Push a commit to the development branch and verify all CI checks run
2. Introduce a linting error and verify the workflow fails
3. Introduce a TypeScript error and verify the workflow fails
4. Fix all issues and verify the workflow passes
5. Verify status checks appear on PRs to protected branches

   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Restrict who can push to matching branches

   - Create a PR to staging branch with passing tests and verify it can be merged
   - Create a PR to main branch and verify it requires staging deployment success
   - Verify direct pushes to protected branches are blocked
6. Create documentation for team members explaining the workflow and protection rules
