   - HeroSection
   - FeaturesSection
   - AboutSection
   - Other sections as per design
4. Implement responsive design using Tailwind CSS grid and flexbox
5. Add animations and transitions using Framer Motion
6. Implement navigation between sections
7. Ensure all content is dynamically loaded from Sanity
8. Add proper SEO metadata
9. Implement lazy loading for images using Next.js Image component
10. Add scroll-based animations and parallax effects if specified in design

# Test Strategy:
