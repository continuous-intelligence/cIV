## üîí Branch Protection & CI/CD

### Automated Quality Assurance

Our repository uses **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration and deployment:

- **Development CI**: Runs on all pushes to `development` branch
  - ESLint code linting
  - TypeScript type checking
  - Prettier format validation
  - Build verification
  - Bundle size analysis

- **Staging Deployment**: Automated deployment to staging environment
  - Quality checks before deployment
  - Automatic staging environment updates
  - Deployment status notifications

- **Production Deployment**: Handled by Vercel's native CI/CD
  - Automatic production deployments on `main` branch
  - Environment variable management via Vercel dashboard

### Branch Protection Rules

| Branch | Status Checks Required | Review Requirements | Direct Push |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| `development` | None | None | ‚úÖ Allowed |
| `staging` | All CI checks | 1 reviewer | ‚ùå Blocked |
